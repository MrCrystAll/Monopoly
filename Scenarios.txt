Monopoly mechanics :
- Ability to buy properties
- Ability to sell properties
- Ability to mortgage properties 
- Ability to build houses on properties (if all properties of the same group/color)


- If a player falls on a slot that belongs to another player
	- If the property is mortgaged, turn ends
	- The player falling on the slot has to pay a "rent"
		- This rent can vary based on the number of houses of the property
		- This rent can double if the player owns all the properties of the same group and there is no house on these properties
	- If the player can't pay, he has to sell
- If a player falls on a card slot
	- The player suffers/get reward from the effects of the card
	- If the player can't pay the effects, he has to sell
- If a player falls on a prison slot
	- He gets immobilized
	- Each turn, the player has the opportunity to
		- Pay the bank to get out, allowing him to play the same turn
		- Roll the dice and
			- Get a double, forcing him to freely get out of prison and play the rolled amount
			- Not get a double, wasting a turn
		- Use a "Get out of prison" card, allowing him to play on the same turn
	- Upon reaching 3 turns of immobilization, the player is forced to leave
- If a player falls on a taxes slot
	- He is forced to give the taxes (amount can vary)
	- If the player can't pay, he has to sell
- If a player falls on a slot that can be bought
	- If the player has enough money to buy it, he can buy it, otherwise, turn ends
	- If the player wishes to buy it
		- The money gets deduced
		- He receives a card, proving he owns the property
	- If the player doesn't want to buy it, turn ends
- If a player falls on a slot that belongs to him
	- If the slot is grouped
		- If the group allows to build houses
			- If he has enough money to buy one house on one property
				- He can choose whether or not he wants to buy one or multiple house on the given property
				- If he wants to buy a house
					- He can choose to buy a certain amount of houses, based on the amount of money he has
						- If he can afford 2 and the property allows for 4, he can buy 2
						- If he can afford 2 and the property allows for 1, he can buy 1
					- He buys the houses
					- Turn ends
				- If he doesn't want to buy a house, turn ends
			- If he doesn't have enough money to buy one house on one property, turn ends
		- If the group doesn't allow to build houses, turn ends
- If a player can't afford something he has to pay
	- If he can sell houses
		- He can choose one or multiple properties to remove houses from
	- If he can sell properties
		- He can choose one or multiple properties to mortagage or sell
	- If he can sell cards
		- He can sell this card to a player
		- If said player(s) refuse to buy the card, the card stays in the player's hand
	- If, given the steps before, he still can't pay, the player loses and is out of the game
